# To-Do List

Simple Todo List app that allows the user to create, update, delete and see their tasks. Built with Phoenix with the objective of learning and applying the concepts of backend programming with Elixir and Phoenix.
Some parts, like the interface, are inspired by the [phoenix-todo-list-tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-todo-list-tutorial) listed in the hacking-learning-path.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
